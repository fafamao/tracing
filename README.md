# Ray Tracing Project üöÄ

A high-performance ray tracer built with C++ and CUDA to generate photorealistic images. This project simulates the physics of light to render scenes with complex interactions, including reflections, refractions, and soft shadows.

## üåü Features

* **CUDA-Accelerated:** Leverages the power of NVIDIA GPUs for massively parallel ray tracing computations.
* **Physically-Based Rendering (PBR):** Simulates real-world materials and lighting.
* **Material System:** Supports various materials like diffuse (Lambertian), metal (reflective), and dielectric (refractive).
* **Camera Model:** Implements a configurable camera with depth of field (defocus blur).
* **Anti-Aliasing:** Uses supersampling to smooth out jagged edges.
* **Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH):** Accelerates ray-object intersection tests for complex scenes.
